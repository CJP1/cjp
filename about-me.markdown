I am a historian of science and of twentieth-century America, currently teaching as Associate Professor in [Carnegie Mellon's History Department](http://www.history.cmu.edu/). My research focuses on the history of science, particularly statistics and mathematics. I am interested in the authority and expertise claimed for scientific practices and mathematical methods across modern U.S. history and most of my projects involve the spread of mathematical and numerical methods into new domains.

Before Carnegie Mellon, I taught as an Assistant Professor & Faculty Fellow at [NYU-Gallatin School of Individualized Study](https://gallatin.nyu.edu/), and before that lectured in the [Department of History of Science, Harvard University](http://histsci.fas.harvard.edu/).

I am currently the General Editor of the [Encyclopedia of the History of Science](https://lps.library.cmu.edu/ETHOS/) and an Associate Editor for the [Harvard Data Science Review](http://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/).

I received my Ph.D. in History of Science in 2011 from [Harvard University](http://www.harvard.edu/) in Cambridge, Mass. Previously, I received an MPhil. in History and Philosophy of Science, Technology and Medicine, from the [University of Cambridge (U.K.)](http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/), and an A.B. in History and Science from Harvard College.
