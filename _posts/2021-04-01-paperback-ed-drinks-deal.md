For the start of the 2021 baseball season, Princeton University Press [released a revised paperback edition of my book, Scouting and Scoring](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691217161/scouting-and-scoring). I also talked with [David Marcus at Drinks with the Deal podcast](https://www.thedeal.com/podcasts/drinks-with-the-deal-author-christopher-phillips/) about the book and my ongoing work. Play Ball!
