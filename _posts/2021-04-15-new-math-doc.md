The documentary filmmaker [Asher Isbrucker](http://asherkaye.com) has put together an excellent documentary film based in part on my [The New Math: A Political History](https://www.amazon.com/New-Math-Political-History/dp/022642149X). You can [watch the film on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvEcFJANVQo). Some really excellent period footage. Enjoy!
