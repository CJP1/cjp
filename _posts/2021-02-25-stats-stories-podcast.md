I was a guest recently on the podcast Stats+Stories, put out by the American Statistical Association and Miami University. You can access it [here](https://statsandstories.net/sports1/the-numbers-behind-americas-pastime), or wherever you get your podcasts. On it I discuss my book Scouting and Scoring, as well as talk about what it means for historians and statisticians to collaborate (as well as what a historian of science *does*...)
