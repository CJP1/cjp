Earlier this spring, I was asked to respond to an [article](https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/29/5/405) in British Medical Journal (BMJ) Quality and Safety about the use of advanced analytics in healthcare. I [posted my response here](https://blogs.bmj.com/qualitysafety/2020/04/19/advanced-analytics-in-healthcare-ready-for-primetime/), explaining some of my thoughts about how healthcare is or is not a particularly good site for the "analytics revolution." 

It's a piece that links my previous book, Scouting and Scoring, to [my upcoming book](/cjp/ongoing-projects/) on numbers in medicine tentatively titled *Number Doctors*.
