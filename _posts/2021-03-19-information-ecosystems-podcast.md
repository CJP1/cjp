I was a guest recently on the podcast that is produced by the Information Ecosystems project at the University of Pittsburgh.  You can access it [here](https://infoecosystems.libsyn.com/episode-17-christopher-phillips), or wherever you get your podcasts. On it I discuss my upcoming book on the history of biostatistics as well as my previous work.
