I recently published a <a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/y7r65r4k" target="_blank">history of precision medicine</a> in the Harvard Data Science Review, as part of the column "Mining the Past" that I edit with <a href="https://hss.sas.upenn.edu/people/stephanie-dick" target="_blank">Stephanie Dick</a>.   

A big part of the story turns out to involve slippage between "precision" as applied to aggregates (the traditional domain of epidemiology) and as applied to individuals (the traditional domain of clinincal medicine). Of course, people mean a range of things by "precision medicine" so there is also some important disentangling to do.

Enjoy!
