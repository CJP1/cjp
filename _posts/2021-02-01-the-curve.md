I wrote a brief essay--really more of a reflection during the pandemic--on the history and meaning of "The Curve" for *Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences*. The online piece is [here](https://online.ucpress.edu/hsns/article-abstract/51/1/159/116288/The-Curve) and you can get a PDF under [Publications](/cjp/publications/).
